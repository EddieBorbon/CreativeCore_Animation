# 🎥 **Unity Animation Project** 🌟

## 🚀 Project Description

The world around us is constantly in motion 🌍, and the same goes for digital worlds. Static environments can feel unfinished and lifeless, but animation brings everything to life ✨! This project is the culmination of my journey learning 3D animation in Unity, where I explored both native animations and imported animations from external software.

In this project, I combined keyframed animations and humanoid rigs, configuring imported clips and making dynamic animation controllers. Get ready to see characters and objects move in vibrant ways! 🎬

## 🧠 Skills Learned

Throughout this mission, I’ve gained essential animation skills 🛠️:

- 🕹️ **Beginner Animation Systems**: Understanding the key components of an animator controller and their relationships.
- 🎮 **3D Animation (Native Unity)**: Creating simple keyframed 3D animation sequences.
- 🌍 **3D Animation (Imported)**: Configuring Animation Clips from DCC (Digital Content Creation) software or the Asset Store.
- 🤖 **Humanoid Rigs**: Setting up humanoid rigs for seamless character animations using Unity’s Humanoid Animation system.
